             You probably haven't had much exposure to closures so this may look a bit confusing, so I'll do a little explaining:
             The function selectedIngredients.index(where:) returns the position of an element in the selectedIngredients array.
             It takes a closure as it's parameter to dermine how to find the position of the element you are looking for. Since
             this is being performed on an array, essentially what is doing under the hood is performing a for-in loop and
             checking that there is an ingredient in the array that matches the name of the ingredient in the row selected.
             So in a for-in loop you might have syntax like this: for ingredient in selectedIngredients { do something }. In
             that context, you use the variable ingredient to access any value in the array and perform any actions you need
             to on it. Well, in the closure here, $0 is used as a substitute for a variable declared for a for-in loop. So in this
             case, selectedIngredients.index(where:) is checking that ingredient ($0) at the position it currently is looping
             through matches the name of the ingredient at the row switch that was selected.
             */
            guard let index = selectedIngredients.index(where: { $0.name == ingredients[indexPath.row].name }) else { return }
